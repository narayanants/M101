Indexex and Monitoring:
=======================

Storage Engine => Interface b/w DB and H/w

Indexes=> finding your docs faster



Storage Engine:
===============

how data is written to disk

how data is deleted/read from disk

data structures used to store data.


MMAPV1 => Maps DB files to virtual memory allowing OS to do all the work.
Wired Tiger => 


MMAPV1:
=======

	makes use of mmap system call to map disk files to memory
	If not in memory a page fault occurs
	fsync propogates it back to disk

	defaultStorage engine in MongoDB 3.0

	--storageEngine mmapv1

	Features:

	Collection level locking
	Locking is shared resources.
	Multiple Readers single writers lock

	Locks:
	=====
	Shared Resources
	Data
	Metadata
	Indexes
	Journal -write ahead log => to ensure consistency.

	Data on Disk are BSON

	Bits are mapped from disk to virtual memory.


	Documents and Data Files in MMAPV1:
	===================================

	local db is used in replication
	local.ns => contains metadata
	local.0 => 64 MB

	Power of 2 sized allocations.

	32=>64=>128=256=>

Wired Tiger:
============

	New in MongoDB 3.0
	First pluggable SE
	Document Level Locking
	Compression
	Lacks some pitfalls of MMAPV1
	Performance gains


	Built separately from MongoDB
	Open Source
	USed by Other DB's



	mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger --logPath /data/mongo.log --fork

	use local
	startup_log => wiredTiger


	WT Internals:
	=============

	Stores files as B Trees
	Writes new version of docs while updation
	Two Caches => WT cache(1/2 RAM)/ FS Cache

	WT Cache => FS Cache => DISK

	Every checkpoint occurs in 60 secs
	Each checkpoint is a consistent snapshot of the data
	No need for Journaling for wired Tiger.
	Writes should scale with the no of threads


	Compression:
	============

	Snappy => fast(more speed)
	zlib => more compression less speed
	none

	Recap:
	=====

	* New pluggable storage engine for 3.0
	* Document level locking
	* compression of docs and indexes
	* Improved performance


	Indexes:
	========

	db.foo.createIndex({foo:1})

	db.foo.find().sort({a:1,b:1})
	db.foo.find().sort({a:-1,b:-1}) => compound index

	not same as 

	db.foo.find().sort({b:1,a:1})

	only +/- directions

	db.foo.getIndexes()


	db.foo.dropIndex()

	* Without indexes, DB does a table scan
	* Keys can be any type
	* _id is automatically created (unique)
	* other than the _id index, explicitly created.
	* automatically used.
	* can index contents of an array.
	* can index sub documents and sub fields
	* ensureIndex()
	* fieldNames are not in the index.

	QUIZ:
	=====

	A MongoDB index can have keys of different types (i.e., ints, dates, string)? True

	UNIQUE INDEXES:
	===============

	"default"
	unique:true
	sparse:true
	flagged:true



	db.foo.ensureIndex(<kP>,<options>)

	Sparse Indexes:
	===============
